# anti-iu-chrome-extension
A chrome extension that removes any text pertaining to IU(still in the works).

## About

Basically, as of right now(8/13/2020), this chrome extension looks for the following key words in all the text elements of any website you are visiting, and removes them:
 - iu
 - indiana university bloomington
 - iu bloomington
 - indiana university
 - bloomington
 
 Below is are images of the IU site without the extension:

 ## How to Test
 
 - clone this repository
 - go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) and enable 'developer mode'
 - from there, click 'load unpacked', and select the folder of this repository
 - you can now toggle the extension on and off, as well as see any errors associated with it
 - for more information on Chrome extensions, look [here](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted).
 
 ## Next Steps
 
 Some things I want to add are:
 
 - functionality to remove logos and IU-associated images. Not sure exactly how to go about this one.
 - another feature that animates any Purdue-associated text to fade between black and gold forever
 - maybe a 'joke' mode that substitutes all IU-associated media and text that says something to the effect of 'IU sucks'
 
 Some known issues are:
 
 - when you have sub-par internet, it can mess up non-IU sites. Still debugging this one.
